# Assignment1
Let us discuss the over all assignment in continuous steps

*Data Preprocessing:
Convert scanned images (.png files) to text using OCR techniques.
Extract text content from the .docx files.

*Feature Extraction:
Utilize techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify entities such as dates, monetary values, and parties involved.
Convert extracted text into a suitable representation for machine learning models (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).

*Model Training:
Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or neural networks) on the labeled training data (train.csv) to predict the metadata fields.
The input features could include textual features extracted from the document content.

*Model Evaluation:
Use the labeled test data (test.csv) to evaluate the performance of the model.
Calculate the recall for each field based on the defined evaluation criteria.

*Deployment:
Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, deploy it as a service where users can upload documents for metadata extraction.
Integrate error handling mechanisms to handle cases where metadata extraction fails or produces inaccurate results.
Here's a high-level outline of the implementation steps you can follow:

1. Data Preparation:
Read train.csv and test.csv to understand the metadata provided for each document.
Preprocess the text data from documents and images.
Extract features such as text content, dates, and monetary values.
2. Model Training:
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task.
Split the training data into training and validation sets.
Train the model on the training set and tune hyperparameters using the validation set.
3. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model on the test set using the defined evaluation criteria (per field recall).
Analyze the performance of the model and identify areas for improvement.
4. Model Deployment:
Develop a user-friendly interface for document upload.
Implement the metadata extraction pipeline using the trained model.
Ensure scalability, security, and error handling in the deployment environment.
Additional Considerations:
Experiment with different NLP and OCR libraries to find the best-performing tools for your task.
Consider techniques like data augmentation to improve model generalization.
Monitor the performance of the deployed system and periodically retrain the model with new data to adapt to changing document formats and patterns.
By following these steps, you can build an AI/ML system for metadata extraction from documents that meets the specified requirements without relying on a rule-based approach.
